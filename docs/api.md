# Python API

The **qontrol** Python API consists of the function **optimize** which performs optimal control, and various models
that can be optimized including **SESolveModel** and **MESolveModel**. There are additionally various utility functions
and classes that help to define an optimization routine (cost functions, file input output, options, etc.)

## Optimization

::: qontrol.optimize
    options:

## Cost functions

::: qontrol.cost
    options:
        show_source: false

## Models

::: qontrol.model

## Custom Plotting

::: qontrol.plot
    options:
        show_source: false

## File utilities
