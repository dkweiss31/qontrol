# Python API

The **qontrol** Python API consists of the function **optimize** which performs optimal control, and various models
that can be optimized including **SESolveModel** and **MESolveModel**. There are additionally various utility functions
and classes that help to define an optimization routine (cost functions, file input output, options, etc.)

## Optimization

::: qontrol.optimize
    options:
        show_source: false

## Cost functions

::: qontrol.cost
    options:
        show_source: false

## Models

::: qontrol.model
    options:
        show_source: false

## Options

::: qontrol.options
    options:
        show_source: false

## File utilities

::: qontrol.utils.file_io
